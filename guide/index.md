# Introduction

## What is Cronflow?

**Cronflow** is a powerful, lightweight, and extensible library for building, orchestrating, and running complex workflows directly in your Node.js and TypeScript applications. It's designed for developers who want the power of platforms like n8n, Zapier, or Temporal.io, but with the flexibility, version control, and expressiveness of a code-first environment.

Built with **Rust + Bun** for unparalleled performance, Cronflow delivers enterprise-grade workflow automation with minimal infrastructure requirements.

## 🎯 Why Cronflow?
